# StarsectorScalaModTemplate

WIP

## Prerequisite

You need to put some game lib jars into the `lib` directory, for this example it is `starfarer.api`

You need a `.env` in the workspace to compile, the content looks like this:

```dotenv
STARSECTOR_GAME_PATH=/path/to/your/starsector/root
```

You need [ScalaPower](https://github.com/zerodegress/starsector-scalapower) as a required dependency.
